# Debugging with ChatGPT üß†üêç

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on enhancing code quality and productivity using ChatGPT to debug, document, and improve Python programs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Objectives

- Understand how to identify and fix common coding errors using ChatGPT
- Learn how to automate repetitive tasks and clean up code efficiently
- Improve documentation practices using AI assistance
- Build real-world debugging skills for both logic and runtime errors

## üìÅ Tasks Completed

### 0. Python Factorial - Debugging
- Fixed infinite loop due to missing decrement
- Added input validation

### 1. Python Arguments - Debugging
- Adjusted `sys.argv` indexing to exclude the script name

### 2. HTML/Javascript - Change Background
- Corrected button ID typo that prevented click event

### 3. Python Minesweeper - Debugging
- Implemented win detection logic when all safe cells are revealed

### 4. Python Factorial (Recursive) - Documentation
- Added full docstring including description, parameters, and return value

### 5. Checkbook - Error Handling
- Added `try/except` for numeric inputs
- Prevented program crashes due to invalid user input

### 6. Tic Tac Toe - Debugging
- Fixed winner announcement logic
- Added input validation
- Added tie condition
- Improved overall game experience

## ü§ñ Bonus: Applying Automation Concepts with ChatGPT

Although this project didn't include dedicated tasks for the "Automation" section, I proactively applied the concepts using ChatGPT in the following ways:

- Generated clean and structured boilerplate code faster
- Used AI to create and polish docstrings for better documentation
- Automated the formatting and logic review of Python functions
- Reduced manual testing effort by simulating edge cases with ChatGPT guidance

This approach significantly improved my coding workflow and gave me a better understanding of how AI can enhance everyday development tasks.
